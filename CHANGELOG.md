# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `mox recent` (alias `r`) — lists the sessions you most recently created or
  attached to, newest first, with their current state (`running` or `gone`).
  Accepts `-n/--limit` (default 10). Backed by a small best-effort history file
  at `$XDG_STATE_HOME/mox/recent.json` (falls back to
  `~/.local/state/mox/recent.json`); this is the only state mox persists.
- `mox list` now shows recently created/attached sessions in a `Recent:` footer.

### Changed

- `mox list` is now a single aligned table (origin, state, window count,
  attached marker, last activity, and host summary) instead of separate
  Configured/Unmanaged sections, and degrades cleanly under `NO_COLOR` and
  non-TTY output.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-28

### Added

- `@cluster` host expansion: `mox new @api-cluster` expands to the hosts
  of a configured session, or to a `clusterssh` `clusters`-file entry
  (nested clusters supported, with cycle detection)
- Shell completion improvements: `--arrange` flag values, `--from` configured
  sessions, `@<TAB>` cluster names, `kill <TAB>` running tmux sessions
- `mox new` command for ad-hoc multi-host sessions (alias: `cssh`).
  Defaults are cssh-style: `--sync`, `--arrange tiled`, `--sudo` on by
  default. Override with `--sync=false`, `--arrange=''`, `--sudo=false`.
  Flags: positional hosts, `--name`, `--connect`, `--user`, `--root`,
  `--from`, `--file`, `--temporary`, `--detach`, `--force`, `--window`
- `--sync` flag and `sync:` config field — enables tmux `synchronize-panes`
  so typing broadcasts to every pane (cssh-style)
- `--arrange tiled|even-horizontal|...` flag and `arrange:` config field —
  applies one of tmux's built-in layouts to a window after panes are created
- `--user USER` flag and `ssh_user:` config field — shortcut for
  `ssh USER@host` without writing a full connect template
- `--sudo` flag — appends `sudo -i` to the per-host commands (pair with
  `--sync` to type the password once)
- `--temporary` flag — sets `destroy-unattached on` so the session vanishes
  when the last client detaches
- `--window` flag — creates a window in the current tmux session instead of
  a new session (only when `$TMUX` is set)
- `mox list` now shows running tmux sessions that aren't in the config,
  in a separate "Unmanaged (tmux only)" section
- Colorized `mox list` output (running=green, stopped=dim, unmanaged=yellow,
  headers=bold). Respects `NO_COLOR` and disables colors when stdout isn't a tty
- Strict YAML decoding (unknown keys now error out)
- `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` support for config path resolution
- `--verbose` / `--quiet` flags using `log/slog` for structured logs
- Configurable per-host connect command template (`connect:` field), defaulting to `ssh {{host}}`
- Signal handling: Ctrl-C cancels session creation cleanly
- `tmux.Tmux` interface to support unit tests
- Unit tests for session manager, builder, config loader
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `release.yml`
- `.goreleaser.yml` cross-compiling linux/darwin x amd64/arm64
- `.golangci.yml` with a curated linter set
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`

### Changed

- Config file written with mode 0600 (was 0644)
- `version.String()` no longer prefixes "mox " - cobra adds the binary name
- tmux errors now wrap original error with `%w` instead of stringifying
- `split-window` size now uses tmux 3.1 `-l <n>%` syntax

### Fixed

- `SessionExists` returned an error when no tmux server was running (now correctly reports false)
- `attach-session` failed when run from inside tmux (now uses `switch-client` when `$TMUX` is set)
- `Makefile` LDFLAGS injected `VERSION` into `GitCommit` (now uses git rev-parse)
- Session/window names containing `:` or `.` now rejected (would corrupt tmux targets)
- Hostnames now validated against `^[A-Za-z0-9._%@-]+$` to prevent shell injection through `ssh` keystrokes
- `--config ~/path` no longer silently fails; tilde is expanded
- `config view` now prints the raw config file (preserving comments) instead of round-tripped YAML
